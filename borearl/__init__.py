borearl package: Modular RL environment and utilities for boreal forest management.

Modules:
- borearl.agents: Training/evaluation entrypoints
- borearl.utils: Profiling and plotting utilities
- borearl.constants: Shared RL-level constants

Note: The CLI entrypoint is `main.py`. Agents dynamically register the environment when needed.
